Its a very simple game built with Jack language.

Plan of the game is, there is a still shooter which shoots a bullet each time you press "SPACEBAR" in your keyboard. And your target is a moving rectangle which is continiuosly moving from up to down. If the bullets hits the target one time, you are the winner.

You can exit the game anytime by pressing "Q" in the keyboard.
